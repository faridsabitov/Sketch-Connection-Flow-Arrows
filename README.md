## Motivation
In our day to day activities, we are creating a lot of diagrams in [EPAM](https://www.epam.com). We understood that most of our time we are spending on connecting and drawing arrows for our user flows and to automate that, I created this plugin


## Download Plugin
The most recent version you can find here:
[**Download the Latest Arrows Sketch Plugin**](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-user-flows/releases)


## Hot Keys
`Cmd + Shift + U` - add a connection arrow between two objects

## Roadmap

- [ ] Allow user to update all the spacings between elements and align everything in grid
- [ ] Allow user to specify arrow from Library

## Bonus

This plugin allows you to provide an arrow between two objects, but for creating user flows and sitemaps you need actual objects to interact with. Don't worry, we got your back!
